<p align="justify">I'm B√°rbara, a Full Stack Software Developer. I have almost 4 years of work experience. I started learning programming in 2017 :sweat_smile:.</p>
<p align="justify"> üéØ Currently, I'm focusing on studying <b>DevOps</b>, <b>Cloud Computing</b>, <b>CI/CD</b>, and <b>Information Security</b>. I'm currently taking courses about these topics.

<h2> About my journey üöÄ </h2>

<p align="justify">When I was a kid, I played video games, I played games on computers, and I used the computer to use the internet to study school subjects, and do my homework from school. </p>

> [!NOTE]
> I always liked to study, and I still do.

<p align="justify">I was at the end of elementary school, so I needed to decide where I wanted to start my High School. I had the option to choose a school that offered technical courses integrated into High School. In other words, they were done at the same time. I had the option of taking an Informatics course, a Mechanics Course, or an Administration Course. I chose Informatics because it was closest to my interests at the period.</p>

<p align="justify">I started the Informatics Course Integrated To High School in 2017. I learned about programming logic and the basics of <b>Java</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>. I'll never forget the patience and dedication of my professors in teaching programming to my entire class. At graduation, in 2019, I was awarded an Honor to Merit certificate for my academic performance. üèÜ</p>

<p align="justify">I truly liked studying programming, and I started searching for where I could study software development. For example, how to create software and how it is designed, such as desktop, web, and mobile applications. I applied to the closest college in a neighboring city.</p>

<p align="justify">Then, I started my undergraduate degree in Analysis and Systems Development, a technologist degree. I started it in 2020 and graduated in 2022. I learned a lot about software development. I'm grateful for the patience and teachings of my professors. At graduation, I was also awarded an Honorable Mention for my academic performance.  üèÜ</p>

<p align="justify">Now, I am planning my career, to pursue my goals. I am determined to enroll in an <b>Information Security Master's Degree</b>.</p>
